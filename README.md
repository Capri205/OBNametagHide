# OBNametagHide
Minecraft bukkit/spigot plugin to hide player nametags in worlds.

Use the /nametaghide or /nth command to toggle on/off in worlds.
Worlds with nametag hiding on are saved to a configuration file and reloaded on server startup.

Useful for PVP servers.

The compiled jar file is also in the target folder of the repo so can be downloaded directly from there.

Compiled for 1.15.2, but should work with older versions (up to a point).
